# Purpose

This project serves as a hands-on exercise to learn and apply system design principles in a practical setting. The goal is to simulate how scalable systems are structured in real-world environments by incorporating concepts such as modular architecture, API orchestration, caching, monitoring, and fault tolerance.

Rather than focusing solely on implementation, this repository emphasizes the translation of high-level design (HLD) diagrams into working modules, documenting architectural decisions, and iteratively refining components based on design patterns used in production systems.

# Problem Statement & Motivation

Retail associates and customers often struggle to find in-stock product alternatives quickly when a desired SKU is unavailable at their local store. This project tackles that problem by designing a system that can retrieve, filter, and recommend substitute products based on inventory, proximity, and relevance â€” similar to how large retailers optimize their backend systems. By approaching this through a system design lens, the project focuses on how scalable architectures handle real-time data retrieval, caching, and ranking logic to deliver fast, reliable recommendations.
